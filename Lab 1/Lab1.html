        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>In this section we were introduced to Ohm's Law, and logic gates. We were immediately introduced to a breadboard which is essentially a platform
            for making experimental models of electric circuits. Next we were given resistors and a multi-meter to measure the resistance. We then
            calculated reistor 1, resistor 2, and the resistance of the resistors in series and parallel. We then wrote down the experimental values
            of these calculations by running a current of 5 volts through the circuit. Then, we used the multi-meter to measure the exisiting current
            through resistor 1, resistor 2, and resistors in parallel.

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What end of a diode must be connected to the ground?</li>
            <p>The back of the diode is what should be connected to the ground because thats where the current is based from.</p>
            <br>
            <li>What would happen if you use a resistor with a much larger resistance?</li>
            <p>Resistors slow current flowing through a circuit; therefore, placing a resistor wire a larger resistance would
                slow the current down even more. However, if the current is at zero (or close), adding more resistance to
                a current that is already at its max resistance, wouldn't do anything since it has reached its limit.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>In this section, we added diodes. A diode is a semiconductor device with two terminals. However, in a diode current can only flow
            in one direction only. To test this theory, we measured the resistance of the diode both ways only to discover that it is true
            that current only flows one way. We then measured the voltage one way, reversed, across the diode with one resistor, and across
            the diode with two resistors in series. Lastly, we assembled a 'wired' gate using two diodes and a resistor (with 15K &#8486)
            according to the instructed design, and connected X and Y inputs on the two switches on the breadboard. Then, we connected the 
            Z output to an LED and made a logic probe.

        <h2>3. Verilog Program</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/georgesuarez/CSE-310/tree/master/Lab%201">Github Link</a>

        <h3>Discussion:</h3>
        <p>We learned how verilog programs worked, and their purpose for our class. It is a programming language that is able
            to simulate hardware, and it is, in our opinion, a eaiser language to work with than other programming languages
            such as assembly. We have successfully completed all parts of the lab resulting in a total score of 20 out of 20 for Lab 1.
